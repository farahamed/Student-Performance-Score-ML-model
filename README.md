Student Exam Score Prediction
ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project predicts studentsâ€™ exam scores based on multiple academic, behavioral, and social factors such as study hours, attendance, motivation level, access to resources, and peer influence.
It uses a Linear Regression model to determine how each factor impacts performance, providing actionable insights for improving student outcomes.
 Dataset from Kaggel:
The dataset contains the following features:
Hours_Studied
Attendance
Sleep_Hours
Motivation_Level
Internet_Access
Teacher_Quality
Tutoring_Sessions
Learning_Disabilities
Access_to_Resources
Extracurricular_Activities
Peer_Influence
Exam_Score (Target Variable)

Technologies Used:
Python 3
Pandas â€“ Data handling
NumPy â€“ Numerical computations
Matplotlib & Seaborn â€“ Data visualization
Scikit-learn â€“ Machine learning model building

ðŸ“Š Steps in the Project:
Data Loading & Cleaning â€“ Handle missing values, encode categorical features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Visualize relationships between features and exam scores.
Feature Encoding â€“ Convert categorical variables to numeric format.
Train-Test Split â€“ Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Model Training â€“ Build and train a Linear Regression model.
Model Evaluation â€“ Evaluate performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² score.
Insights â€“ Identify which factors most influence exam scores.

ðŸ“ˆ Model Performance:
Mean Squared Error (MSE): 5.50
RÂ² Score (Test Data): 0.646
Train Score: 0.627
